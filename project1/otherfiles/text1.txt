I firmly believe that automation might not make the world go around but it definitely makes the going much smoother. Over the years automation has intricately weaved itself in to our lives, right from the coffee maker we use in the morning to Python coding to automate text search and self-driving cars. Automation is good, so long as we know exactly where to put the machine.
Having worked in a startup, I have evolved not only as a professional Python Django Developer but also as a leader. I taught 5000 plus students on English Literacy and Soft Skills as an outreach activity. It was a roller-coaster she ride, yet I was able to manage hectic schedules with ease thanks to experience and my love to work with people.

Passion and determination is what I work with and this has always proved me to be different from others and made me what I am today.
